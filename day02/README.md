# Day 02 â€“ 2-Input OR Gate

## ðŸ”§ Description
This project implements a 2-input OR gate in Verilog.  
The output is `1` when **any one or both inputs are `1`**, and `0` only when both are `0`.

## ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes
- Usage of bitwise OR (`|`) in Verilog
- Testbench design for logic gates
- Observing gate behavior via waveform
