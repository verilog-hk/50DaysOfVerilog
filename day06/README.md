 Day 06 â€“ NOR Gate

 Description
This project implements a 2-input NOR gate in Verilog.  
The output goes HIGH only when **both inputs are LOW**; otherwise it is LOW.

  Learning Outcomes
- Using bitwise OR (`|`) and NOT (`~`) to build NOR
- Truth table verification in simulation
- Extending the logic-gate series with completeness (NAND + NOR)

 ðŸ§ª Truth Table
| A | B | C = ~(A \| B) |
|---|---|---------------|
| 0 | 0 | 1             |
| 0 | 1 | 0             |
| 1 | 0 | 0             |
| 1 | 1 | 0             |
